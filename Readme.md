# Lombiq Login as Anybody for Orchard Core


## About

Orchard Core module for administrators to be able to log in as any user. The Orchard 1 version of the module is available on the branch `dev-orchard-1`.


## Documentation

After enabling the module you'll see a new button on the Security â†’ Users page. You can log in as any registered user there. This is useful if you want to see how your Orchard Core app behaves for certain users.

This feature is only available to site owners, thus it's not way to get around security.
