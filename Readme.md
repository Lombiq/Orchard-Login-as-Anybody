## Project Description
Orchard module for administrators to be able to log in as any user.


## Documentation

After enabling the module you'll see a new tab under Users. You can log in as any registered user there. This is useful if you want to see how your Orchard app behaves for certain users.

This feature is only available to site owners, thus it's not way to get around security.

The module's source is available in two public source repositories, automatically mirrored in both directions with [Git-hg Mirror](https://githgmirror.com):

- [https://bitbucket.org/Lombiq/orchard-login-as-anybody](https://bitbucket.org/Lombiq/orchard-login-as-anybody) (Mercurial repository)
- [https://github.com/Lombiq/Orchard-Login-as-Anybody](https://github.com/Lombiq/Orchard-Login-as-Anybody) (Git repository)

Bug reports, feature requests and comments are warmly welcome, **please do so via GitHub**.
